**LIQUID LEVEL MONITORING AND OVERFLOW PREVENTION SYSTEM USING IoT FOR VISUALLY IMPAIRED**
• Make the connections properly.
\\\\
• Connect the Arduino UNO to your system and the program is dumped into Arduino IDE.
\\\\
• For power supply we are using Two lithium-ion rechargeable batteries.
\\\\
• Mini size solar panel is used to recharge the battery.
\\\\
• Level sensor detects the liquid level from cup or a glass and send it as input to Arduino.
\\\\
• Once the level of the liquid is detected the output will be displayed on LCD and assists through speaker.
• The Temperature sensor will be calculating the temperature of the liquid and send it as input to Arduino.
• If Temperature is greater than threshold then it will display the output as “liquid is hot”, else it will
display the output as “liquid is cold” and assists through speaker.
• The Multi-Channel voice module is used, which provides a variety of voice options to alert the user about
the liquid’s level and the temperature.
